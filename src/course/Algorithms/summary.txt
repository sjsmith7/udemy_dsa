Biggest takeaway, learn what sorting algorithm your language is using.
- Python uses Timsort, a combination of QuickSort and Insertion Sort.
- JS is engine dependent, V8 (Chrome) uses an Insertion sort for smaller data inputs TimSort for larger input
- Java also uses Timsort

1.Merge Sort
Divide & Conquer. 0(n log(n)). Great for large data, good for performance, ensures we keep 0(n log(n)) for worst case.

2.Quick Sort
Divide & Conquer. 0(n log(n)). One of the most popular. Worst case is bad (if the pivot is incorrectly implemented)

# Merge sort and Quick sort are the most dominant sort methods.

Insertion sort
Should be used with only a few items or when items are mostly sorted. It uses little space, easy to implement

Bubble sort
Avoid. Usually only used for educational purposes

Selection Sort
Avoid. Usually only used for educational purposes

Heap Sort
Sorts in place. Slower than quick sort in most cases. Useful if memory constrained.

Non-Comparison Sort - These only work with Integers in a certain range e.g 0-100 are the only natural numbers that could be used
Counting sort
Radix sort
